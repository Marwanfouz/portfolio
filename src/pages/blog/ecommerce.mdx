# Welcome to ecommerce

Creating a comprehensive platform for shoping services was an exciting challenge with team of frontend and backend developers. This ecommerce project allowed me to explore various technologies and implement several key features to enhance the user experience.
the project is a full-stack e-commerce platform that allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and complete the checkout process. The platform also includes an admin panel where administrators can manage products, orders, and customers.
but it sill in development stage and will be published soon.
