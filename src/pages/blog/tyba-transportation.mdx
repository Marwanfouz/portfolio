### Project Overview

Tyba Transportation is a platform designed for booking and reserving transportation services. The website features a user-friendly interface and a robust admin panel that allows administrators to manage cars, edit pricing, add blog posts, and update contact information.

### Key Features

**Admin Page**: The admin page is a central hub where administrators can:

- **Manage Cars**: Add, edit, or remove cars from the fleet.
- **Edit Pricing**: Update the pricing for various transportation services.
- **Add Blogs**: Post new blogs and keep customers informed about the latest updates and offers.
- **Change Contact Numbers**: Update contact information to ensure customers have the latest details.

### Technologies Used

- **Typescript**: Ensuring type safety and reducing bugs.
- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering and enhanced performance.
- **Bootstrap**: Providing a responsive and mobile-first design.
- **Firebase**: Handling authentication and real-time database updates.

### Challenges and Achievements

Building the Tyba Transportation platform came with its own set of challenges. Ensuring seamless integration of the admin features while maintaining a user-friendly interface was crucial. However, overcoming these challenges was incredibly rewarding, and the final product is a robust and scalable transportation booking system.

### Conclusion

The Tyba Transportation project showcases my ability to build a complete web application with both frontend and backend components. The experience gained from this project has been invaluable, and I am excited to apply these skills to future projects.
